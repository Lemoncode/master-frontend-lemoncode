# 10 Handling Images

In this demo we are going to include images in our project in two flavours: via JavaScript and via HTML.
On the JavaScript side we will see it's something straightforward (using the same plugins we used for fonts), for the HTML we will use a new loader: [`html-loader`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/html-loader).

We will start from sample _09-refactor-src_.

Summary steps:

- Add two images to our project.
- Add first image from JavaScript.
- Add second image from HTML.
- Install [`html-loader`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/html-loader).
- Configure the loader.

# Steps to build it

## Prerequisites

You will need to have nodejs installed in your computer (at least v 8.9.2). If you want to follow the steps of this guide you must take as starting point the sample _09-refactor-src_.

## Steps

- Run `npm install` to install previous sample packages:

```
npm install
```

- Let's start by cleaning up our _`index.html`_. We are going to remove the Bootstrap's _jumbotron_ component and add a `<div>` element with a given `id`:

_./src/index.html_

```diff
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>Webpack 3.x by sample</title>
  </head>
  <body>
-   <div class="jumbotron">
-     <h1>Testing Bootstrap</h1>
-     <p>
-       Bootstrap is the most popular ...
-     </p>
-   </div>
+   <div id="imgContainer"></div>
    Hello Webpack 4!
    <div class="red-background">
      RedBackground stuff
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

- We will continue by creating a folder named **content** inside the **src** folder, and adding two images there: [`logo_1`](./src/content/logo_1.png) and [`logo_2`](./src/content/logo_2.png).

- Let's jump into _`index.js`_ and import [`logo_1`](./src/content/logo_1.png) using JavaScript.
  Then, let's place it under a `<div>` with a given `id`:

_./src/index.js_

```diff
import {getAvg} from "./averageService";
+ import logoImg from './content/logo_1.png';

$('body').css('background-color', 'lightSkyBlue');

const scores = [90, 75, 60, 99, 94, 30];
const averageScore = getAvg(scores);

const messageToDisplay = `average score ${averageScore}`;

document.write(messageToDisplay);

+ const img = document.createElement('img');
+ img.src = logoImg;

+ document.getElementById('imgContainer').appendChild(img);
```

- In webpack 5, now don't need to use loaders to load picture, we can use the build int asset module,
  let's update our _`webpack.config.js`_ (note down this is a type, not a loader)

_[webpack.config.js](webpack.config.js)_

```diff
  module: {
    rules: [
      ...
+     {
+       test: /\.(png|jpg)$/,
+       type: 'asset/resource',
+     },
    ],
  },
```

- Next, we will add some styles for the images in our CSS file:

_./src/mystyles.scss_

```diff
$blue-color: teal;

.red-background {
 background-color: $blue-color;
}

+ img {
+   display: block;
+   width: 200px;
+ }
```

- And run `npm start`. We should be able to view the image in the browser.

```bash
npm start
```

- That's fine but what if we had already the image referenced inside a HTML `<img>` tag? Let's add [`logo_2.png`](./src/content/logo_2.png) into the index.html file:

### ./index.html

```diff
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>Webpack 3.x by sample</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="imgContainer"></div>
    Hello Webpack!
+   <img src="./src/content/logo_2.png"/>
    <div class="red-background">
      RedBackground stuff
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

- Now if run the app (`npm start`) we can check that both logo images are being shown.

```bash
npm start
```

- Finally, if we open the developer tools in our browser we can see that a `<img>` has been inserted under the `<div>` element, and also that its `src` attribute has changed:

- But we are referencing [`logo_2`](./src/content/logo_2.png) from `./src..` path. Whats if we upload to production? We loose the reference so we need to process this kind of files using `html-loader`:

```bash
npm install html-loader --save-dev
```

- And configure the loader for the _.html_ files

_webpack.config.js_

```diff
      {
        test: /\.(png|jpg)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        loader: 'url-loader?limit=5000',
      },
+     {
+      test: /\.html$/,
+      loader: 'html-loader',
+     },
    ],
  },
```

- We need to set an extra step, set the public path (try not to do so and check the error), more info about public path:
  https://webpack.js.org/guides/public-path/

```diff
  output: {
    filename: "[name].[chunkhash].js",
    path: path.resolve(process.cwd(), "dist"),
+    publicPath: "/",
  },
```

- And remember that the webpack `context` is over `./src` so:

_./src/index.html_

```diff
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <title>Webpack 3.x by sample</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="imgContainer"></div>
    Hello Webpack 4!
-   <img src="./src/content/logo_2.png" />
+   <img src="./content/logo_2.png" />
    <div class="red-background">
      RedBackground stuff
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

- We can see now that image is auto referenced (F12 developer tools...).

- Let's check that this is working fine in our generated bundle.

- We are going to install a lite web server globally (lite-server).

```bash
npm install lite-server -g
```

- Let's generate the bundle:

```
npm run build
```

- Let's open the terminal, hop in to _dist_ folder

```bash
cd dist
```

- Let's run connect and open a browser to check if the image is shown or not (lite server is running under http://localhost:3000).

```bash
lite-server
```
