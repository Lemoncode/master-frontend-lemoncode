# Summary

Now is your turn to get your hands wet coding with some challenges :)

# Challenges

- The memberTable component was a cool thing, and it contains
  the header and member Item subcomponent, could you create
  a subcomponent for the header (we will play this with having
  the componente in the same file or a separate one).

- We want in the CSS grid a link to the Github Profile of each
  member:

  - You can extract the info from: https://api.github.com/orgs/lemoncode/members

  - Remember to create an _anchor_ HTML element.

  - We want to get all this typed.
