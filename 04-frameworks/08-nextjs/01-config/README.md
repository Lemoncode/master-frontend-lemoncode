# 01 Config

In this example we are going to add a basic setup needed to work with Nextjs

We will start from `00-boilerplate`.

# Steps to build it

`npm install` to install previous sample packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Install necessary libraries.

```bash
npm install next --save
```

> [Or using create-next-app](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation)

Now, we can add the necessary npm scripts:

_./package.json_

```diff
  "scripts": {
+   "start": "next dev",
    "start:api-server": "cd api-server && npm run mock-server",
    "postinstall": "cd ./api-server && npm install"
  },
```

Before Nextjs 13, we used to create pages inside the `pages` folder and the rest of our files with our custom project structure. Now, with the new version, we can place files inside the `app` folder and every component will be a `React Server Component` by default.

[It's required create a `root layout`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#root-layout-required) inside `app/layout.tsx` with the required <html> and <body> tags:

_./app/layout.tsx_

```jsx
import React from 'react';

interface Props {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

const RootLayout = (props: Props) => {
  const { children } = props;
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
};

export default RootLayout;
```

Create the `root page`:

_./app/page.tsx_

```jsx
import React from 'react';

interface Props {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

const RootLayout = (props: Props) => {
  const { children } = props;
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <main>{children}</main>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
};

export default RootLayout;

```

Run `start`:

```bash
npm start
```

> Open `http://localhost:3000/`
>
> NOTE: Since we are using typescript, nextjs add automatically `tsconfig.json`, `next-env.d.ts` files with default values and install `@types/node` for us.

This is great to work with Nextjs in dev mode, but we need to add more commands to works with production mode:

_./package.json_

```diff
  "scripts": {
    "start": "next dev",
+   "build": "next build",
+   "start:prod": "next start -p 8080",
    ...
  },
```

> Default PORT in prod mode is 3000 too.

Run `build` and `start:prod`:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start:prod
```
