# 02 Github actions

In this example we are going to create a production server using Github pages and Github actions.

We will start from `03-github-branch`.

# Steps to build it

`npm install` to install previous sample packages:

```bash
npm install
```

We will use same approach as `gh-pages` example, but we will use [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions) for automatic deploys.

Create new repository and upload files:

```bash
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com...
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push -u origin main
```

Install [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) as dev dependency to deploy to Github pages:

```bash
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
```

Add deploy command:

_./package.json_

```diff
  "scripts": {
    "start": "run-p -l type-check:watch start:dev",
    "start:dev": "vite --port 8080",
    "prebuild": "npm run type-check && npm run clean",
    "build": "vite build",
+   "prebuild:dev": "npm run prebuild",
+   "build:dev": "vite build --mode development",
+   "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist",
    ...
  },
```

Run dev build and deploy it:

```bash
npm run build:dev
npm run deploy
```

> NOTE: We can run deploy because we have access to repository
>
> since we are logged in Github

Add GitHub actions CD workflow:

_./.github/workflows/cd.yml_

```yml
name: CD workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  cd:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy
        run: npm run deploy
```

Add commit with changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "add continuos deployment"
git push
```

As we saw, the workflow failed. Why? Because each time a Github job is executed, it's a new and clean machine outside repository. That is, we need to allow job's git push. The best approach is creating a new ssh key on local:

```bash
ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -C "cd-user@my-app.com"
```

```bash
> Enter file in which to save the key: `./id_rsa`
> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): `Pulse Enter for empty`
> Enter same passphrase again: `Pulse Enter for empty`
```

> NOTES:
>
> -m PEM: Format to apply. PEM is a common public/private key certificate format.
>
> rsa: RSA is the crypto algorithm.
>
> Enter `./id_rsa` to save files in currect directory
>
> You can leave empty the passphrasse field.

Copy `id_rsa.pub` content to `Github Settings` > `Deploy keys` section:

![01-public-ssh-key](./readme-resources/01-public-ssh-key.png)

![02-public-ssh-key](./readme-resources/02-public-ssh-key.png)

Delete `id_rsa.pub` file.

Copy `id_rsa` content to `Github Settings` > `Secrets` section:

![03-private-ssh-key](./readme-resources/03-private-ssh-key.png)

![04-private-ssh-key](./readme-resources/04-private-ssh-key.png)

Delete `id_rsa` file.

Now, we can use this shh private key to do a commit/push in Github's job:

_./.github/workflows/cd.yml_

```diff
name: CD workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  cd:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

+     - name: Use SSH key
+       run: |
+         mkdir -p ~/.ssh/
+         echo "${{secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY}}" > ~/.ssh/id_rsa
+         sudo chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa

+     - name: Git config
+       run: |
+         git config --global user.email "cd-user@my-app.com"
+         git config --global user.name "cd-user"

      - name: Install
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy
-       run: npm run deploy
+       run: npm run deploy -- -r git@github.com:<your-repo>.git

```

> NOTES:
>
> "Use SSH key" step: create id_rsa with ssh private key in default ssh folder and add write permits.
>
> "Deploy" step: update deploy command with repository's SSH URL.
>
> [gh-pages -r flag](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages#optionsrepo)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "configure git cd-user permits"
git push
```
