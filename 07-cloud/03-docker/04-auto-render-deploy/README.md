# 04 Auto render deploy

In this example we are going to upload Docker image with a front app to Render.

We will start from `03-upload-docker-image`.

# Steps to build it

`npm install` to install previous sample packages:

```bash
npm install
```

[Render](https://render.com/) is a cloud provider that allows you to deploy different types of apps based on git repository changes.

Create new repository and upload files:

![01-create-repo](./readme-resources/01-create-repo.png)

```bash
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com...
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push -u origin main

```

Create a new _Render_ app:

![02-create-render-app](./readme-resources/02-create-render-app.png)

Configure account to get access to the new repository:

![03-configure-account](./readme-resources/03-configure-account.png)

Configure web service:

![04-configure-web-service](./readme-resources/04-configure-web-service.png)

![05-configure-runtime](./readme-resources/05-configure-runtime.png)

Update docker settings (Advanced settings):

![06-docker-settings](./readme-resources/06-docker-settings.png)

Clicks on `Deploy Web Service` button.

After the successful deploy, open `https://<app-name>.onrender.com`.

As you can see, _Render_ does not care about the _PORT_ environment variable in the Dockerfile, it uses the port 10000 by default. We can remove it:

_./Dockerfile_

```diff
...

- ENV PORT=8080
CMD node index.js

```
